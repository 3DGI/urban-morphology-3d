# === Per object ===

# Object type

# Volume
# Volume of convex hull
# Volume of BB

# Surface area
# Surface area by semantic surface

# Number of vertices
# Number of surfaces
# Number of vertices by type
# Number of surfaces by type

# Max height
# Min height
# Range (max-min)
# Mean, median, mode

# Topology
# Unique vertices
# Unique surfaces
# Connectivity of buildings
# Height difference between adjacent buildings

# Directionality of footprint
# Directionality (?) of surfaces (normals)
# Perimeter of footprint

# Differences and perectages between volumes

# Number of points of footprint
# Shape complexity of footprint
# Shape complexity in 3D
# Spread points and compute the distance to the centroid

# Shape metrics (for footprint or 3D):
# Spin index (Σd²/n) (normalise by EAC)
# Dispersion (Σd/n) (normalise by EAC)
# Maximum spanning circle (aka girth index) (normalise by radius of EAC)
# Elongation
# Linearity

# === City level analysis ===

# Density

# Clusters of heights
# Clusters of footprint areas
# Clusters of height range

# Connected components
