# === Per object ===

# Object type

# Volume
# Volume of convex hull
# Volume of BB

# Surface area
# Surface area by semantic surface

# Number of vertices
# Number of surfaces
# Number of surfaces by type

# Max height
# Min height
# Range (max-min)
# Mean, median, mode

# Topology
# Unique vertices
# Unique surfaces
# Connectivity of buildings
# Height difference between adjacent buildings

# Directionality of footprint
# Directionality (?) of surfaces (normals)

# Differences and perectages between volumes

# Shape complexity of footprint
# Shape complexity in 3D

# === City level analysis ===

# Density

# Clusters of heights
